# :page_facing_up: Piloting Inclusive Workshops of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for children 
## Abstract
In this paper, we present preliminary work from a pilot workshop that aimed to promote diversity and inclusion in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics in the context of developing countries to children of an range age between 6 to 12 year old.
We pose the challenge of teaching AI and Robotics in developing countries where scarcity of funding and little specialised professionals are available to teach such subjects.
In that way, we present resources based on free open-source hardware and software, open educational resources, and alternative education programs to promote diversity and inclusion and to teach AI and Robotics for children. 
We present the design and the pilot of four lessons of the workshop including: (a) motivation and applications, (b) teaching fundamentals, (c) linking sensor and human body anatomy with robots and (d) applications and showcase presentations.
We conclude that participant, instructors, coordinators and parents engaging well in the four lessons of the workshop noting the various challenges of having enough resources to organise workshops with a major number of participants.
