# Inclusive HRI Workshop: Equity and Diversity in Design, Application, Methods, and Community

## Statement of Objectives
Although being a pressing issue, an understanding of how robotic systems can replicate and amplify inequalities and injustice among underrepresented communities is still to be achieved within the HRl community. This workshop contributes to filling this gap by exploring the research questions: What do Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mean in the context of HRI? How can we promote DEI in HRI? Our goal is to raise awareness on the importance of including DEI aspects in HRI to avoid exacerbating existing or creating new biases. This workshop will center around the themes of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Human-Robot Interaction.  An additional goal of this workshop is to build community and solidarity among researchers in HRI who work on and are affected by these various and related  issues. More information on the workshop can be found on the [dedicated website](https://sites.google.com/view/dei-hri-2022/home).


## Submission Guidelines
We invite authors to submit extended abstracts (up to 2 pages, excluding references) and short papers (up to 4 pages, excluding references) on a range of topics relevant to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in HRI. Submissions may present current or in-progress research, position papers, critical essays, and summaries of already published research from all areas of HRI. Since we hope to learn from other fields of knowledge and  form new connections with  related research communities, we also welcome submissions from researchers outside of the HRI community.

Deadline for Paper Submission: February 4th, 2022
Paper Acceptance Notification: February 18th, 2022
Camera Ready Paper: March 4th, 2022
Workshop date: March 11th, 2022
Papers should be formatted according to the [IEEE two-column format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Submissions will be evaluated according to their fit to the workshop theme, and their adherence to the scientific standards of the discipline of origin. The workshop proceedings will be made publicly available on our website
