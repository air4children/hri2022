## Notes

AIM
"We investigated the size of drawings in children with CP and
hypothesized that larger drawings would be associated with
poorer walking ability and increased CP-related distress. The
study also aimed to examine the content of the drawings to see
if this could be a useful indicator of walking ability and illness
perceptions"

DISCUSSION
"The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships
between drawings, illness perceptions, and walking ability in chil-
dren with CP. Larger figure height was related to less walking
distance achieved and greater emotional impact relating to CP.
Similar to previous work, the size of the drawing seemed to
suggest how much the individual focused on the subject."
