abstract="Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching and learning materials that are available without access fees and with licensing that affords innovation through OER-enabled pedagogy. In this chapter, we review the financial impact of OER and research evidence that the quality of OER is comparable to that of commercial materials. This is followed by an explanation of how OER licensing allows instructors to revise materials and how OER can be adapted to be more culturally responsive, effectively aligned with learning objectives, and inclusive of student needs. By promoting access to materials, being adaptable to student needs, and providing diverse communities the opportunity to share their voices and knowledge, OER serve as tools to improve teaching and learning and promote social justice in higher education. We present future directions for OER research and implementation as well as sample initiatives to support the adoption of OER and activities that incorporate OER-enabled pedagogy.",
