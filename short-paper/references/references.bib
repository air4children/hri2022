abstract={Montessori, Waldorf, and Reggio Emilia education remain three of the most popular models for alternative early childhood education. Each of these approaches has developed globally, with a rich history of supporting children's educational freedom. This narrative analysis provides a means for early childhood educators and scholars to understand the aims, philosophical and theoretical frameworks, historical development, benefits, and challenges in these models and their methods of practice. As early childhood education evolves with technology and as re-conceptualizations about early education occur, an understanding of these alternatives to traditional education models is important. While adaptive options of these models may emerge in education systems across national contexts, this review allows educators to consider their applications and cultural appropriateness in specific local and community contexts.},

Shelly has a tortoise-like friendly appearance and touch based simple and versatile interface, which encourages children to interact with the robot spontaneously in environments such as amusement park or kindergarten. We have developed two prototypes and proved validity of Shelly»s social concepts - one-to-many interaction and restraining robot abusing - through field tests. Ultimately, Shelly»s novel interface and interaction model targeted for multiple-children interaction would effectively attribute to various social goods.},

abstract="Deep Learning (DL) has shown real promise for the classification efficiency for emotion recognition problems. In this paper we present experimental results for a deeply-trained model for emotion recognition through the use of facial expression images. We explore two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures that offer automatic feature extraction and representation, followed by fully connected softmax layers to classify images into seven emotions. The first architecture explores the impact of reducing the number of deep learning layers and the second splits the input images horizontally into two streams based on eye and mouth positions. The first proposed architecture produces state of the art results with an accuracy rate of 96.93 {\%} and the second architecture with split input produces an average accuracy rate of 86.73 {\%}, respectively.",

abstract = {We observed how 102 children (7-12 years old), from four different countries (U.S.A, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden), imagine smart devices and toys of the future and how they perceive current AI technologies. Children outside of U.S.A were overall more critical of these technologies and less exposed to them. The way children collaborated and communicated while describing their AI perception and expectations were influenced both by their social-economical and cultural background. Children in low and medium SES schools and centers were better are collaborating compared to high SES children, but had a harder time advancing because they had less experience with coding and interacting with these technologies. Children in high SES schools and centers had troubles collaborating initially but displayed a stronger understanding of AI concepts. Based on our initial findings we propose a series of guidelines for designing future hands-on learning activities with smart toys and AI devices for K8 students.},
