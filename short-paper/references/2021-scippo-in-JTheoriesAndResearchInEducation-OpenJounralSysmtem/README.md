## Notes

"An education in technology that is harmoniously integrated with the education of the person requires a school
environment in which there is free choice, dexterity, collaboration, autonomy, metacognition, multi-sensorial-
ity. In short, a school that is different from the still dominant one, mainly transmissive, frontal, anti-inclusive
and is equal on unequal parties.
"


«The thought itself originates not from another thought, but from the motivational sphere of our con-
sciousness, which contains our passions and needs, our interests and impulses, our acts and emotions. The
sphere of the active and volitional tendencies is concealed behind the thought which, alone, can give an
answer to the last “why” about the analysis of thought» (p. 226, auth. trans.).

abstractNote={Here, we contribute to the debate on the relationship between Montessori’s pedagogy and new technologies. In this longitudinal study we used a mixed methodological approach, relying on structured evidence, field observations and notes. We show how in children, following the use of technological material aimed at developing computational thinking, in the five years of primary school in a Montessori class in Grottaferrata (RM), creativity and a sense of community have increased. The sense of community has consistently remained at a good level. The pervasiveness due to the error at a low level. Our evidence indicate how technological materials must respect the typical characteristics of Montessori development material to be integrated in school job: freedom of choice, error control, aesthetic attractiveness, autonomy of use, manual interactivity, possibility of collaborating with peers, repetition of the exercise, quantity limits are essential characteristics.},
