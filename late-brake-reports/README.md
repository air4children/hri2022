# The Late-Breaking Reports

The Late-Breaking Reports (LBR) venue at HRI provides authors with the opportunity to present early-stage results and new ideas over exciting cutting-edge and experimental research. 
LBRs are an excellent opportunity for researchers new to the field to participate in the conference.

All LBR submissions will undergo blind light-touch peer-review and will be published in the companion proceedings of the conference. 
These proceedings will appear in both the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. 
LBRs will be presented during the main conference. 
The final format for the presentation will be communicated in January 2022.

LBRs should be 2-4 pages long (excluding references).


## Important Dates
* December 3, 2021 (23:59 Anywhere on Earth): Submission Deadline for LBRs/Videos   
* January 07, 2022: Notification of acceptance   
* January 18, 2022: Final camera-ready deadline  

## Submission Instructions LBR
Authors must submit their Late-Breaking Reports as a 2 to 4-page article, excluding references (which do not count towards submission length). 
Templates for 2022 are under preparation, and will be shortly available from the conference website.

In connection with SIGCHI’s efforts to improve conference accessibility, HRI is moving towards generating accessible PDFs for all accepted papers. See below for details.

Publications should be fully anonymized at the time of submission. 
For additional information, authors may refer to the main conference anonymization guidelines.

Due to a tight publication deadline with the publisher, all submitted Late-Breaking Reports should be “camera-ready” at the time of submission (i.e., proofread, spell-checked, etc.). 
Non-conforming submissions are candidates for instant rejection.

## Studies with Human Participants
To support building a strong evidence base in HRI, and encourage future reproducibility of published work, all submissions involving studies with human participants should clearly outline their methodology regardless of the theme they are submitted to, including:   
* ethical aspects considered and clearance obtained where appropriate (c.f., Geiskkovitch et al. 2016, Sections 5.2, 5.4)
* participant demographics and sampling approach (c.f., de Graaf 2017, Section 2.3)
* data collection and analysis methods (c.f., Paepcke and Takayama 2010, Section V)
* study environment and context (c.f., Short et al. 2018, Section 3.5)
* if a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm was used, a detailed description of the robot, wizard, user, etc. (c.f., Riek 2012, Table 2)
* if a robot was used, a detailed description of the platform, its level of autonomy, capabilities, etc. (c.f., Beer et al. 2014, Figure 5)
